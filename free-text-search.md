# Free text search

Using the `q` URL parameter, you can search for text across multiple pre-defined fields:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q=dit is een test
```

## Fields

The following fields will be searched when using the `q` parameter with free text:

`id`, `name`, `description`, `labels`, `terms.id`, `terms.label`, `performer.name`, `addressLocality`, `postalCode`, `streetAddress`, `location.id`, `location.name`, `organizer.id`, `organizer.name`

**Important notes:**

* IDs only return results if the complete ID is given in the free text input.
* Name & description fields are translatable, but currently only the NL translations are searched when using free text search.
* Searching for a part of a word does not work yet. For example, searching for `Fiets` will not return an event with the title `Fietsen langs de Dijle`.

## Operators

By default the `OR` operator is used in between multiple given words.

So the query `wandelen fietsen dijle` actually becomes `wandelen OR fietsen OR dijle`.

It is possible to define the operator you want to use in the query itself.  
You could, for example, search for:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q=(wandelen OR fietsen) AND dijle
```

See the [Query String Query syntax for ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax) for more info, or more documentation on [advanced queries](/advanced-queries.md).

## Exact matches

By default the free text search looks for one or more matches with any of the given terms, regardless of their order and/or position in the document's text.

For example, both an event with the title `Lekker veggie` and a different event with the title `Veggie eten is lekker` would be returned as results when searching for `q=lekker veggie`.

To limit the results to exact matches, encapsulate the given search terms with quotes:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q="lekker veggie"
```

This will only return results that have `lekker veggie` in exactly that order in their text.

Encapsulated terms can still be combined with other terms, for example:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q="lekker veggie" eten bereiden klaarmaken
```

## Localization \(Translations\)

By default the free text search looks for matching terms in both the original documents and their translations.

To limit your free text queries to one or more specific languages, you can use the `textLanguages` URL parameter.

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q="the editors"&textLanguages[]=nl
```

You can search through multiple languages by repeating the same parameter with a different value:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q="the editors"&textLanguages[]=nl&textLanguages[]=fr
```

Note that the `textLanguages` parameter does not filter documents by their available languages. For example, when searching in both `nl` and `fr`, you can get results that only have either one language but still have a matching term in that specific language.

To actually filter documents by their available languages, see [Languages](/languages.md).
