# Media objects

Currently it's only possible to filter events and places by their number of media objects.

## Url parameter

You use the `hasMediaObjects` URL parameter to find all events and places that have at least one media object:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?hasMediaObjects=true
```

Or all events and places that have no media objects at all:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?hasMediaObjects=false
```

## Advanced queries

Using [advanced queries](/advanced-queries.md) and the `mediaObjectsCount` field, you can filter all events and places by the number of media objects they have.

For example, all events and places that have at least one media object:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q=mediaObjectsCount:>=1
```

All events and places that have exactly one media object:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q=mediaObjectsCount:1
```

All events and places that have less than 10 media objects:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q=mediaObjectsCount:<10
```

All events and places that have 5 to 10 media objects:

```
GET https://search.uitdatabank.be/offers/?q=mediaObjectsCount:[5 TO 10]
```
